# Vibent

## What is this?

Vibent was a side-project we worked on during our studies. We advanced to a relatively mature stage of development, but dropped the project when both main developers, [@joubert-m](https://github.com/joubert-m) and [@ConorRyan](https://github.com/ConorRyan) decided they did not want to pursue the project when finishing their studies. Some code has now been made public to serve as a portfolio or for inspiration for others. We are aware there are secrets and passwords peppered throughout some repos - this is not an issue as they are all useless now.


## Project Description

Vibent is an application for collaboratively managing events between friends, family and colleagues.

A user creates a Vibent account or logs in through a social network. On the platform, they can join or create groups. In the latter, they can invite their friends to join them by email or via a sharing link. Once in a group, each member can create events which are automatically shared with the whole group.

From then on, each member will be able to interact on the event through a board containing all the information relating to the latter.

The main problem when planning a multi-party event is the organization and structuring of data. Vibent answers this problem by offering so-called bubbles, in which all participants can contribute and participate. We currently offer 6 bubbles on the board of each event: Food, Transport, Checkbox, Survey, Planning and Free. Each bubble has its functions and meets a specific organizational need. For example, the Transport bubble allows you to manage travel to the event. Each participant can then propose a route and places in his means of transport or make a request to the rest of the group to be taken there.

On the event and in the bubbles, the changes of all the participants are visible in real time.

The application is currently in alpha version, we have identified several areas for improvement: redesign, new bubbles, addition of other social networks, ...
